# Building Azure infrastructure using Terraform and Terraform Enterprise Challenge Guide

Below is a series of "challenges" or guided exercises to help attendees learn about Terraform and how to use it to create Azure Resources. These are not meant the be "hands-on labs" or step-by-step guides. The goal is to provide a series of exercises that have an expected outcome. Some steps and code will be provided. In the end, the hands-on experience should lead to a deeper level of learning.

## Prerequisites

- Laptop
- Azure account with access to deploy at least 10 cores and permissions to generate a service principal. A trail Azure account can be created for this event.
- Github Account (Free)
- Terraform Enterprise Account. Attendees will be provided a 30-day trial.

Setting up your laptop for the challenges is done in Challenge 00 - Getting Started.

## Challenges

For each challenge, change your working directory to the folder for that challenge.
Each challenge is meant to be independent of each other.
If you get stuck, refer to the `solutions` directory for a working solution to the challenge.
