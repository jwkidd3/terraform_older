# 10 - Sentinel Policy with Terraform Enterprise

## Expected Outcome

In this challenge, you will see how you can apply policies around your Azure subscriptions using Sentinel Policies.


## How to

### View Policies

In the Terraform Enterprise web app, click on your organization -> Organization Settings

https://app.terraform.io/app/YOUR_TFE_ORGANIZATION/settings/policies

### Create Policy in App

Click "Create new Policy"

### Create Policy from API

Create the following policy:

__Policy Name:__ ResourceGroupRequireTag

__Policy Enforcement:__ advisory (logging only)

__Policy Code:__

```hcl
import "tfplan"

required_tags = [
  "owner",
  "environment",
]

getTags = func(group) {
  tags = keys(group.applied.tags)

  for required_tags as t {
    if t not in tags {
      print("Resource Missing Tag:", t)
      return false
    }
  }

  return true
}
main = rule {
  all tfplan.resources.azurerm_resource_group as _, groups {
    all groups as _, group {
      getTags(group)
    }
  }
}
```

### Run a Plan

Queue a plan for the workspace `app-dev`.

### Review the Plan

Will see the plan was successful but there was a policy failure, however the option to Apply is still available.

### Update the Policy

Update the Policy Enforcement to be `hard-mandatory`.

### Run a Plan

Queue a plan for the workspace `app-dev`.

### Review the Plan

This time the the run fails due to the hard enforcement.

### Update Workspace

In the `app-dev` workspace, add the following to the `azurerm_resource_group` declaration:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "module" {

...

  tags {
    Owner = "me"
  }
}
```

Save and commit the code to your repository.

### Run a Plan

Run another plan.

> Note: You may need to discard the last non-applied build.

### Review the Plan

The plan should succeed and now pass the sentinel policy check.

## Advanced areas to explore

1. Write another Sentinel Policy restricting VM types in Azure.
